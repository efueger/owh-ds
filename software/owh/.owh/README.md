This directory contains all external configuration for the OWH application.

On a deployment, this folder copied outside the source folder of the application and OWH_HOME environment variable to set to point to this folder.
Configuration files in the $OWH_HOME folder should be updated with the correct configuration for the deployed environment before starting the application.
$OWH_HOME/owh-config.yaml is the main configuration file for the application.
If $OWH_HOME is not set the application will default the main config file location as $HOME/.owh

A special configuration property config.OWH_HOME will point to the OWH_HOME folder explicitly set by the user or the default value of $HOME/.owh

Any file generated by the OWH application like the logs file and any marker files should be generated under appropriate subfolders in this folder.
E.g., the application logs files should go under $OWH_HOME/logs folder.
